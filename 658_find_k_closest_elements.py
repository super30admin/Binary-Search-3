Problem: 658. Find K Closest Elements
Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/
Approach:
    1. Keep high as length - k and move towards the starting point by using binary search.
    2. To move, go towards high or low based on the distance of x from mid and mid+k elements.
    3. Once low and high cross, low will be pointing towards the starting point
        and we can return the next k elements from that point.

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
Any problem you faced while coding this : No
