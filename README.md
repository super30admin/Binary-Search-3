Find K Closest Elements (https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/)






## Problem3
Optimize Air Routes (https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/318918/amazon-online-assessment)

INPUT
The input to the function/method consisits of three arguments:
maxTravelDist, an integer representing the maximum operating travel distance of the given aircraft;
forwardRouteList, a list of pairs of integers where the first integer represents the unique identifier of a forward shipping
route and the second integer represents the amount of travel distance required bu this shipping route;
returnRouteList, a list of pairs of integers where the first integer represents the unique identifer of a return shipping route
and the second integer represents the amount of travel distance required by this shipping route.

OUTPUT
Return a list of pairs of integers representing the pairs of IDs of forward and return shipping routes that optimally utilize the given aircraft. If no route is possible, return a list with empty pair.

Example 1:
Input:
maxTravelDist = 7000
forwardRouteList = [[1,2000],[2,4000],[3,6000]]
returnRouteList = [[1,2000]]

Output:
[[2,1]]

Explanation:
There are only three combinations [1,1],[2,1],and [3,1], which have a total of 4000, 6000, and 8000 miles, respectively. Since 6000 is the largest use that does tnot exceed 7000, [2,1] is the optimal pair.

Example 2:
Input:
maxTravelDist = 10,000
forwardRouteList = [[1,3000],[2,5000],[3,7000],[4,10000]]
returnRouteList = [[1,2000],[2,3000],[3,4000],[4,5000]]

Output:
[[2,4],[3,2]]
