// Three line explanation of solution in plain english
/* Two pointer approach :- Set low and high pointers to start and end of i/p array. 
 * Goal is to have exactly k elements in between low and high pointers by performing following operations repeatedly.
 * If distance between x and element pointed by low pointer is greater than distance between x and element pointed by high pointer 
 * then increment low pointer else decrement high pointer.
