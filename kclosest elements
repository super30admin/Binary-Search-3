//Time complexity:- o(logn)
//space complexity:-0(1)
//Did it run on leetcode:- yes
//What problem did you face:- took time for one error case.
//your code with explanation:-it is a two point approach first pointer will be at index, last pointer will be at last.
//iterating until high-low>=k if absolute value of arr[low]-x is greater than arr[high]-x incrementing low or decrementing high.
// from low to high adding to output.
